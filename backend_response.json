NT-proBNP improved risk stratification compared to LVEF alone, indicating its prognostic value in mid-term mortality assessment."

A radiomics-based risk score (RAD score) showed superior prognostic value over clinical models in predicting major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) during a 2.9-year follow-up.
